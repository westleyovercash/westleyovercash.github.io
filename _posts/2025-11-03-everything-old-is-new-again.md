title: Everything old is new again
date: 2025-11-03

Back in the blog boom era (think Nokia candy bar phones) I created the first blog on a bestselling innovation and strategy book. "It's a boring subject. No one will read it," folks said. And that's why you shouldn't pay too much attention to what others say. It wasn't until ten years and 1,200 posts later that I put it to bed. 

Everything old is new again the worn expression goes. I've found that in business and in life it wields great truth. The baggy raver jeans I wore at university have come back in style and are almost on their way out again. People are as scared of AI as they were of having AOL dial up in their homes. 

I'm starting this new blog because there are so many experiences and feelings where we can connect. Especially at a time when it seems we're encouraged to disconnect from each other. I hope you will feel comfortable visiting here—just like those days when I used to sit down with a cup of coffee and start my morning with the blogs I loved (and not doomsday scrolling). And that you will take away something that might make you look at your day just a little bit different.
