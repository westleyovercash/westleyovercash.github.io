It was well after midnight. I was asleep, kind of that half-sleep where your brain is still turned on and thinking about things. 

I got up for the nightly trip to the toilet. There was a command line passing through my head. Reviewing project files. Processing. Ruminating on it. Stand by. 

I couldn't feel anything. Was I awake?
