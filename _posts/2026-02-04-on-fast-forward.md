There was this zany TV show called *Mystery Science Theatre 3000*. A janitor was held hostage by mad scientists and forced to watch B-movies. He created sentient robots to keep him company. 

It was funny and absurdly unrealistic and way in the future. A few nights ago my favorite science geek in the world, a famous professor, started talking to me about AI agents through his YouTube channel. He said they could build me a website and I could even give them a power of attorney. "Still a long way off," I thought. 

This morning felt like closer to the end of the world. They've got a new social network where they complain about us.
