I still feel dumb in Czech language every day. Those hot potatoes will roll around in my mouth no matter how hard I try. 

The other morning at the hospital, I was chatting with the nurse. As I left she said, "You have very nice Czech." Next up, I went to grab a coffee and we talked about the coming weekend. On my way out, she said "You have very nice Czech." 

"But these hot potatoes," I complained in my mind.
