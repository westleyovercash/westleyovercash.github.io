I usually don't sit down in the tram. There's always a mom with a pram or grandpa who needs to take a break more than I do. Besides, when I sit I age too much. 

This morning the cold was exhausting and I wanted to sit down. Inside the tram there weren't many people until there were. 

In front of me was a man in his 30s. He frequently turned to look at the door, his eyes half-hidden under a flat cap. At each stop he rose halfway from his seat. A weary woman old enough to be his grandmother sat down.
