I was in the book store the other day looking for the new book about Tuberculosis. 

There was a child probably about five and in full meltdown mode. Her Mom who looked more tired than most moms grabbed her by the arm and began to tug her outside. The girl pushed back. 

I thought, "I'm glad I don't have to put up with that." Then I remembered I do—and there's a monthly fee attached.
