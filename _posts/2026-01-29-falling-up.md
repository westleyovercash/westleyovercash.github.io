I remember reading once that about 75% of falls on stairs are downstairs. Gravity not being our friend and all. 

I've been convinced most of my life that if I'm ever going to fall to my death it's going to be upstairs—definitely not downstairs. Folks have always laughed at my theory. 

The other day I was sitting in a meeting in a café adjacent to a busy metro station. A set of stairs was nearby. A young man bolted up them two at a time, eyes locked on his phone. Two steps away from the top of his journey the full face plant happened. 

I guess I'm not the only one.
