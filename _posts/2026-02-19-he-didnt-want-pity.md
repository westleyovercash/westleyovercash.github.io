Today was Thursday, my favorite day of the week because it's close to the end but not yet. Despite that I still had enough worries to last into next week already. 

I noticed him in his wheelchair which could have been as large as a refrigerator. Half of his body melted into the table as he ate his cheesecake with strawberry topping. 

He finagled the next bite into his mouth.
