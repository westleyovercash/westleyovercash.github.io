Yesterday I was late again. I was trying to zip up my coat without tumbling down the icy sidewalk. I couldn't miss the next tram. 

But it was slow going. Walking arm-in-arm in front of me was a couple that looked like they had leaned on each other for decades upon decades. They paused to adore each other's smile as they chatted and pointed to small miracles along the way. 

They reminded me of my own parents. I slowly walked behind them and watched so I could have a visit.
