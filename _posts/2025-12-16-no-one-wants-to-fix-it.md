There is construction across the street. When you live in a city—especially one this old—the only direction to build is up so that the sun can never see you. They start before the garbage man comes and continue on weekends and sometimes even holidays, too. 

I doubt most of the workers really want to be here. Some can be seen stumbling as they negotiate the heavy workload. Doing everything they can to forget how their destinies have been shaped by forces far away now playing a deadly game. 

Two of them use wheelbarrows. One of the wheelbarrows   squeaks. Tinnitus would be a blessing compared to this sound. It penetrates through thick concrete walls, all the way to the nearest tram. 

The solution for that squeak is expensive for the workers. I could pitch in. My neighbours could pitch in. But we’ve all just become used to it.
