title: The man in the wheelchair

He was in a wheelchair and had no legs. Three police officers interrogated him there on the sidewalk in the freezing cold. 

In the evening I was exhausted and just wanted to be snug at home. And there it was: a car straddling that same sidewalk—a wall on one side, oncoming traffic and icy slush on the other. 

Now I was angry. I mouthed words through the window at the vehicle's only occupant. She stole my soul with her silent stare.   

Didn't she understand about the man in the wheelchair?
