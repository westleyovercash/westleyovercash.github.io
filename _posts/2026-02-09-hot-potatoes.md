I still feel dumb every day when I speak Czech. Those hot potatoes will roll around in my mouth no matter how hard I try. 

The other morning at the hospital, I was chatting with the nurse. On my way out she said, "You have very nice Czech." After that, I went to grab a coffee and was chatting with the cashier about the coming weekend. On my way out, she said "You have very nice Czech." 

"But these hot potatoes," I said to her. She gave me permission not to worry about them so much.
