My high school years were the unhappiest of times. And my favorite teachers saw that.  

Mrs. Rivers would stand behind the lectern every Friday in her UNC team gear, brag about barbecue, and give the hardest tests. She also talked to me about the nuances of *The Awakening*. When I wanted to know what it would be like to travel at the speed of light, Dr. Clayton stayed after school. Even though most kids said she was a robot and had no emotions.

I'm still curious because of them.
