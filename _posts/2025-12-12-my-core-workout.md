I used to be a news buff. It was as much of a staple in our house as sweet tea growing up. I learned a lot about the way the world supposedly worked around that dinner table. 

Decades later and I had become the fact checker in chief. Over the past months, I've decided that most conversations about the news are just an exercise. An exercise in showing off who has the biggest bias, and that bias works like a muscle. 

The more I flexed, the more it seemed to matter. But it didn't help my core. 

I quietly unsubscribed from the talking heads. I started observing real people and their real problems. I listened more. And I returned to writing.
