My mood was pulling me down. When that happens there's always one person that can bring me back up. I queued up her best hits and plugged in there on the platform.

She started singing to me how I'm "simply the best" and "better than all the rest." 

My head bobbed up and down and that's when I spotted him. Hunched over, clinging to walking sticks, he too was plugged in. 

Tina danced on his screen.
