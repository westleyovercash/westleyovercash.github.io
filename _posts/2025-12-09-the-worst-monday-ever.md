title: The worst Monday ever

A lot of folks dread Mondays. Just scroll through Instagram on a Sunday evening. You would think Monday is judgement day. 

The toughest Monday in my life came around this same time 14 years ago, when I was in the midst of pr-ing the launch of a client's book. 

I was getting used to life after a youthful heart attack. My relationship with my partner was disintegrating. And our rental agreement on the flat wouldn't be renewed. I was living proof that bad news comes in threes.  

I opened my calendar that morning and it smelled of overwhelm. All the dates and times were changing. Who and what could I rely on any more? Our two kids were too young to understand any of this. But at least I still had Bibo. 

All these moving parts. Situations change. People change. Everything is always in flux. The first time I heard and fell in love with Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde," I learned there's actually a name for it. It's called unresolved tension. 

There will always be unresolved tension. Mondays aren't so bad after all.
