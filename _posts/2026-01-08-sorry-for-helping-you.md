We stood in line like food aid recipients. It had been two-and-a-half days since we last congregated here.

Shoppers, now anxious to prepare for the new year, cut me off. I knew that if I could just make it to self-checkout I was almost home.

Store employees stocked already full shelves. Perhaps their frantic movements were a result of complaints. And each of them received news of these complaints as the assistant manager broadcast her disgust through her headset. 

Several boxes of Earl Grey fell at my feet. The assistant manager's hands were full. Automatically I picked them up and handed them over. She snatched them back.
