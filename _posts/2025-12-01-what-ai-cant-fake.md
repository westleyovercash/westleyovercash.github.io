title: What AI can't fake

There was a market here in Prague. I think most major cities have these kinds of markets. You could find anything there. And when pretending hard enough, the fake handbags and watches almost seemed real. If you could get past the mechanical defects and strange smell. 

It reminds me of AI and writing these days. In a few clicks you can go from writing marketing copy to authoring your own book series on marketing. But, like the folks in the market selling their fake wares—and the people flaunting them—they don't want to be found out. 

AI is brilliant. I have previously advocated for it to be unleashed—something I might regret if you noticed that em dash. It is the ultimate tool for curiosity seekers—the kinds of folks like me who burdened their parents incessantly with "how does this work?" and "why?" 

But LLMs lack the most important thing for storytelling: lived human experience.
