I have a friend. You probably have one like him too. He's a joy to be around. But sometimes it's the slightly unaware way he communicates. 

When that happens it feels less like my friend talking. And more like a recital made of equal parts academic privilege and F500 pimpery. 

My friend lives in Spain where bedtimes are sadistically late. I live in Prague, which has historically had one of the earliest start times on the continent. So we tag each other a lot on DM. The response to our last electronic waltz was, "I can't right now. Let's choose a mutually convenient time during the week." 

"Mutually convenient time?" I often wonder: does he perform this same corporate recital with everyone? But perhaps he had a long day and was just tired—and so that was the first thing that came to mind. Then I reminded myself that I was trained to participate in that very same recital. For that longest time I talked that way too. It was easy and oddly comfortable. 

How long it took me to find my own voice again—it's another reason for restarting my blog. So next time around, when it comes to a "mutually convenient" time, perhaps I'll just suggest something like "How about now?"
