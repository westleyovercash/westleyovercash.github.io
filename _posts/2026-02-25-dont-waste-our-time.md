At the bank I was hoping to find a person empathetic to my 25 years with them. 

Instead, there was a sigh and a "bohuzel." Unfortunately, no. Turns out it was my fault for their merger and my account being grandfathered in. 

Then came the automated email: "Dear client, did you know you can manage your account in our app?"
