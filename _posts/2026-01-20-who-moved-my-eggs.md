title: Who moved my eggs?

It was the weekend and so there was more time for breakfast. But I was one egg short of a big enough omelette.  

At the store I scanned the dairy aisle. It contained everything but eggs. "Weird, this is where they've always been," I told myself. 

There must have been another bird flu crisis. All those poor chickens culled. Or maybe there was some new tariff on eggs that had come up over night? Was there a hidden camera somewhere? Was I about to be the joke of a reality TV show?  

A sign with tiny print pointed elsewhere.
