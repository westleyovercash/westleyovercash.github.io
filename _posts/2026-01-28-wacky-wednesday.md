It started with a cough that wouldn't let me finish sleeping. Then the morning alarm beeped its way into my meditation. 

I sat down to write. "Maybe AI can do a better job than me after all?" as self doubt took over. Lunchtime was marred with a spaghetti stain on my shirt. Then one client call cancelled, another rescheduled. 

Putting on my shoes to take a walk I busted out laughing. Dr. Seuss had written about these kinds of Wednesdays.
