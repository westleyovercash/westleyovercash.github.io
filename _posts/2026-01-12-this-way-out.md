There's an escalator at a Metro stop here in the city center. It's not calibrated like the others. It's stubborn that way, and has been for years. 

If you lean against the handrail, your upper half will advance out in front of you. It's easy to lose your balance and almost fall. 

The escalator stretches to the center of the earth and back. So the ride gives me plenty of time to ponder. Is war coming closer, will robots take my job? Did I remember to pack my lunch? 

The way out appears.
