title: She helped us forget

Stampedes of doctors and nurses passed by at regular intervals. A few of them mistook me for a pharmaceutical rep. 

Most that waited in front of me were older, so it was understandable why they were there. Some looked at me with curiosity. Others envious of me for having more time left. But most were slouched over in heavy breath lost in their own worry. 

I watched as she greeted each of them one by one—something I had never seen before. Their reciprocal smiles helped them forget why they were here. For each one she knew about their interests, about their storied careers, about their loved ones. And every single palpitation in between. 

She appeared at the door again. I was next.
