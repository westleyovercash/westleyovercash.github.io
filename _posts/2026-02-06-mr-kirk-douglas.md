This morning starts with a trip to the hospital for blood work. It’s down to every six months now.  

When I’m lucky, my number in the queue points me to my favorite nurse. She probably draws blood faster than any of the other nurses. She calls me Mr. Douglas, like the famous actor. Not because I look like him, but because of my middle name. 

I hope our stars are aligned again today.
