It was our honeymoon. David had seen an advert for the Seychelles on TV. I wanted to give him everything so where we were going had already been decided. 

Jemma at the Mango Lodge warned us of the deceptive waters that lapped at La Digue. He dove off the pier, I lost sight of him. Then I saw his hands and bloodied head waving. For life. 

I dove in after him.
