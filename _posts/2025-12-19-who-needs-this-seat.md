title: Who needs this seat?

I usually don't sit down on the tram. There's always always a woman with a pram or grandpa who needs the seat more than I do. Besides, when I sit too much I age.

But this morning the cold had exhausted me and I wanted to sit down. In the tram there weren't many people until there were. 

Seated in front of me was a man in his 30s. He frequently turned to look at the door, his eyes half-hidden under a flat cap. At each stop he rose halfway from his seat. A weary woman old enough to be his grandmother sat down.
