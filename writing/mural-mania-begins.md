# Mural mania begins

If you have noticed a few more splashes of color on Prague’s streets lately, you’re not imagining it. A new wave of public murals is transforming the city’s walls into open-air galleries that blend art, community, and urban storytelling. What started as a fringe movement is now catching mainstream attention.

## The rise of street art in Prague

Once considered vandalism, street art in Prague has matured into a respected form of cultural expression. From Žižkov’s bold facades to the tucked-away courtyards of Holešovice, artists are reclaiming forgotten spaces and turning them into canvases for social commentary. Local initiatives like the Wall of Fame and the Street Art Festival have given new legitimacy to the scene, encouraging both local and international artists to participate.

## Beyond paint: culture and collaboration

Many of the city’s new murals are community-driven projects, created in collaboration with residents, businesses, and schools. They tell stories about neighborhood identity, history, and resilience. In a city so rich in architectural heritage, murals are adding a contemporary layer—one that speaks to the present moment without erasing the past.

Corporate sponsorship is also playing a role, but not in the way you might think. Instead of sterile advertising, companies are funding artists to create work that genuinely enhances public spaces. It’s a win-win: artists get visibility and resources, while brands earn cultural capital for supporting creativity.

## A living gallery

As summer unfolds, more walls across Prague are set to transform. From underpasses to apartment blocks, the movement shows no signs of slowing. The next time you’re out for a walk, look up—you might find a new story painted on the side of a building, reminding you that art doesn’t just live in museums.

Mural mania has begun, and Prague’s streets are brighter for it.
