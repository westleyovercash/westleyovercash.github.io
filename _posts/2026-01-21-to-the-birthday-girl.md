My sister was the one who liked birthday parties. I didn't care for them. But she still does. 

One year for Kim's birthday all her friends gathered after school. We danced the Hokey Pokey at Sparkles roller rink and ate pizza and birthday cake. 

Today will start with her morning phone call to God. She will be doted on all day by her three kids, husband, dog, our parents, and friends.    

And she might sneak a swig of Hershey's syrup from the bottle in the fridge.
