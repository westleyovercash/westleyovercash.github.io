At the gym I ran into two college kids from California, one tall enough to be a basketball post. 

They worked out in street clothes and street shoes. Over their playlists they shouted their progress back and forth. They were at every machine all the time. The regulars slammed their weights down. 

I tried talking to the basketball post. Nothing but that vacant stare in return.
