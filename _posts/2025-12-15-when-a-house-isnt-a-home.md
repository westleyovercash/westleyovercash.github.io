Imagine someone builds a beautiful house, but it's completely landlocked. It's entirely surrounded by other properties and there's no road leading to it. None of the windows face south and the doors are all on the second floor. 

Inside, the occupants worry about one thing: what color to paint their house. Because it's a house and always will be. It will never be a home. 

I was asked to edit a pitch deck last quarter. It was one of "those" houses. It would have meant a lot of money, but that would never be enough to cover the cost of the paint.
