A lot of us dread Mondays. Just scroll through Instagram on a Sunday evening. You would think Monday is judgement day. 

The toughest Monday in my life came shortly after the passing of a new year. I was in the midst of pr-ing the launch of a client's book. 

I was getting used to effects of meds prescribed after my at an early-age heart attack, my relationship with my partner was disintegrating, and nd our rental agreement on the flat wouldn't be renewed. I was living proof that bad news comes in threes.  

I opened my calendar that morning and it smelled of overwhelm. All the dates and times were changing. Who and what could I rely on any more? Our two kids were too young to understand any of this. But at least I still had Bibo. 

All these moving parts. Situations change. People change. Everything is always in flux. The first time I heard and fell in love with Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde," I learned there's actually a name for it. It's called unresolved tension. 

There will always be unresolved tension. It took me over a decade to accept that. Once I finally did, I found Mondays aren't so dreadful after all.
