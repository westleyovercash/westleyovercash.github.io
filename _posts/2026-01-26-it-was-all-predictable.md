It was a peculiar bunch. Amongst them I could quickly spot my former mentor, a previous client, and even someone who means the world to me. 

Their emails had arrived within days of each other. They all wanted my feedback on new business ideas, which made me feel kind of important. And I like helping. 

Some ideas were interesting and new, others not worthy of a reincarnation. All of them gave a vibe that success was incoming and certain. A simple 1-2-3 path had been identified. The high praise was identical. 

Just regurgitated digital aspartame.
