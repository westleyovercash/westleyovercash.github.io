title: When to stop?

I only met one of my grandpas. He was the most determined person I ever knew.

He would fix roofs under the oppressive Georgia sun. He would make a garden sprout in the harshest soil. He would help neighbors with their projects. And if you ever needed to borrow a ladder or a tool he'd bring it to you. 

Keeping going is the dominant gene in our family. No one knows how to stop even when our bodies tell us to.

For a couple of days this week, I allowed myself not to be like him.
