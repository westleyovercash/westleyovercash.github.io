I was in kindergarten. Most of the time it was fun, especially since Mrs. Cook reminded me of my grandma.  

In our classroom there were two restrooms. One door had a picture of Kermit the Frog and the other had Miss Piggy. Those were the rules. One day I really had to go. Kermit was locked. Miss Piggy wasn't. But then what would everyone think? 

Dad came to pick me up at school. I was wet with nature and tears. On the drive home he told me everything would be okay.
