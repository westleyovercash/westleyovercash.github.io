I usually don't sit down on the tram. There's always someone who comes along who needs to sit down more than I do. Besides, when I sit too much I age.

But this morning I was already exhausted and wanted to sit down. There weren't many people in the tram with me until there were. 

Seated in front of me was a man in his 30s. He frequently turned to look at the door, his eyes half-hidden under a flat cap. At each stop he rose halfway from his seat. A weary woman old enough to be his grandmother sat down.
