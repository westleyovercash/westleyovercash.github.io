There's a reality TV show famous around the world featuring Gordon Ramsay and struggling restaurateurs. 

Price cuts on encyclopaedia-size menus foreshadow bankruptcy. What could have been brilliant, local signature dishes are replaced with plates of mush that even zoo animals would reject. Customer faces resemble kids eating broccoli for the first time. And broken down owners can't remember what made them different anymore. 

Scrolling through my social media feeds, it all tastes slop.
