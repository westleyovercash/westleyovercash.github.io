title: She makes my day

Her name is Vira. It's impossible to forget. That was the name of my great aunt. But she was from Tennessee. This Vira comes from a country freckled with war stains. 

Vira works at the McCafe in town. I started going there because it was a convenient place between meetings to catch up on work. Or at least that's what I tell myself. It's probably more for my favorite pastime: people watching. And certainly because I am not a coffee elitist—I actually prefer dark roast to citrus. 

I know that Vira enjoys rainy days like me. I know that, like me, she'll spend the holidays not where she grew up, but with her adopted family. 

She makes more than my coffee: she makes my day.
