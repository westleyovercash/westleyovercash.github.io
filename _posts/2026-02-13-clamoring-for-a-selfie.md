We were standing there talking in front of St. Vitus Cathedral. There was no yesterday or today, just this moment. 

The monk's crimson robe drew stares that I hadn't previously noticed. Teenagers in football kits pushed their way through the crowd to get closer to him like he was Ronaldo. They all wanted a selfie.

I felt how conflicted he was. What came next was the middle way.
